# Computational Economics


## 🎯 Goal of Economic Research
The primary objective of economic research is to uncover statistical relationships 📊 and leverage these insights to improve the world 🌍. Economists typically have a broad range of interests, allowing them to explore various facets of economic behavior and policy.

## 💻 What is Computational Economics?
Computational economics involves constructing mathematical models of economic systems 🧮 to conduct experiments 🔬. This approach allows researchers to investigate how changes in input variables affect economic outcomes, offering a unique perspective on real-world scenarios.

### ❓ Why Choose Computational Economics?
Conducting real-world economic experiments can be prohibitively expensive 💸 and often limits the scale and generalizability of findings. By using computational models, we can simulate various economic conditions and policies without the high costs associated with physical experiments.

## ⚖️ Key Considerations
### 🔄 The Lucas Critique
One critical insight from economic theory is the Lucas Critique, which states that changing equilibrium conditions can alter behavioral responses ⚡. When implementing new policies, previous statistical relationships may not hold unless there is a causal explanation for these changes. Simply put, people will adjust their behavior in response to new incentives.

### 📈 Quantitative Realism
To provide a more accurate assessment of potential outcomes under different economic policies, we must build slightly more complex models of the economy 📉. This approach, known as quantitative realism, aims to enhance our understanding of the dynamic interplay between various economic factors.

## 📚 Dynamic Programming
Dynamic programming is a powerful tool in computational economics, with the cake-eating problem serving as a core example. 

### 🍰 The Cake Eating Problem
Imagine you are given an entire cake today, which you need to ration for the rest of your life 🎉. The challenge is to determine how much cake to consume each day to maximize your overall utility 🍽️. This problem exemplifies the trade-offs that individuals must navigate to extend or maximize their utility over time.
